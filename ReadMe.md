# ROS-TOPIC-VIEWER-PYQT

This project is a ROS2-based application that allows you to monitor and visualize ROS2 topics using a PyQt5-based GUI. The application supports displaying messages of type `Image` and `PointCloud2`, leveraging OpenCV and OpenGL for image and point cloud visualization respectively.

## Features
- List and select available ROS2 topics.
- Visualize `sensor_msgs/Image` messages.
- Visualize `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` messages using OpenGL.
- Display non-image message data in a readable format.

## Future Updates
This code is planned to be updated with additional features and optimizations.
Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
